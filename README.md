This experiment was conducted as part of a homework assignment for a scientific programming course. 

The facial stimuli were taken from the FamFac database, 
originally published in 
“FamFac – A Database of Famous Faces for Psychology Experiments” 
by Fábio Monteiro, Paulo Rodrigues, Isabel M. Santos, Pedro Bem-Haja, and Pedro J. Rosa.

The FamFac database is openly available at: https://osf.io/x3vsy/.
