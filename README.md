This experiment was conducted as part of a homework assignment for a scientific programming course. 

The facial stimuli were drawn from the FamFac database, originally introduced 
in FamFac – A Database of Famous Faces for Psychology Experiments 
by Monteiro, Rodrigues, Santos, Bem-Haja, and Rosa (2018).

The FamFac database is openly available at: https://osf.io/x3vsy/.
